# Improved TODO Agent Implementation

## Summary of Changes

I've implemented the suggested improvements to fix the issues with redundant LLM responses and improve the handling of TODO queries. Here are the key changes:

### 1. **Response Filtering System** (`response_filter.go`)
- Created a `ResponseFilter` class that removes:
  - Internal reasoning patterns (e.g., "I should", "Let me think")
  - Duplicate content
  - Code blocks and response markers
- Extracts the most coherent response from multiple attempts
- Ensures clean, direct answers to user queries

### 2. **Query Analysis System** (`tools/analyzer.go`)
- Built a `QueryAnalyzer` that identifies query intent:
  - Most important task queries
  - Difficulty/easiest task queries
  - Summary requests
  - Priority listings
- Maps natural language queries to appropriate tool commands

### 3. **TODO Service Layer** (`tools/service.go`)
- Created `TodoListService` for high-level task operations
- Provides direct methods for common queries:
  - `GetMostImportantTask()` - Returns formatted response for priority queries
  - `GetTasksByDifficulty()` - Ranks tasks by time estimates
  - `GetTaskSummary()` - Comprehensive task overview
- Handles formatting without multiple LLM calls

### 4. **Improved Agent** (`improved_agent.go`)
- Built `ImprovedAgent` that extends the base agent
- Directly handles known query types without LLM tool selection
- Falls back to regular processing for unknown queries
- Significantly reduces response time and eliminates redundancy

### 5. **LLM Configuration** (`model.go`)
- Added configuration for:
  - Lower temperature (0.3) for more consistent responses
  - Reduced max tokens (300) for conciseness
  - Stop sequences to prevent rambling
  - System prompt for direct, helpful responses

### 6. **Enhanced Agent Processing** (`agent.go`)
- Added `isTaskQuery()` to identify TODO-related queries
- Implemented `handleTaskQuery()` for efficient processing
- Created specialized formatting functions
- Integrated response filtering throughout

## Usage

The improved agent can now handle queries like:

```
> What is my most important task today?
The most important task is "name the biggest slug Edward" (Priority: Critical). You have 1 critical task(s), which is 25% of your active tasks.

> Can you show me my TODO list ranked by difficulty, showing my easiest tasks first?
No tasks have time estimates to determine difficulty. Add time estimates to tasks using 'add <task> time:XXm'.

> Give me a summary of my tasks
## Task Summary

### Overview:
- Total Tasks: 4 (4 active, 0 completed)

### Current Focus (Top 3 Priorities):
1. name the biggest slug Edward [Critical]
2. give Crosby, my dog, a bath [Medium]
3. Buy Alice a Lagoona Na doll for her birthday [Medium]
```

## Benefits

1. **Faster Responses**: Direct query handling reduces processing time
2. **Cleaner Output**: No more exposed reasoning or duplicate answers
3. **Better Structure**: Clear separation between query analysis, execution, and formatting
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new query types and responses
5. **Consistency**: Predictable responses for common queries

## Testing

Run the improved agent with:

```bash
chmod +x test_improved.sh
./test_improved.sh
```

The system now provides clean, direct answers to TODO queries without the previous issues of multiple response attempts and exposed internal reasoning.
